  		<h2>About Me</h2>
  		<p> My name is Jhon Michel Diaz de Leon but I go by Mike Diaz. I am a very outgoing person who enjoys walks on the beach at night. I was born and raised in Aguascalients Mexico. I moved to Unites States when I was 12. While in the US I went to school up until high school. After high shool I decided to start working in the hospitality industry as a server and bar man. With time I grew to love motorcycles and started saving money to start my own business. Motorcycles became a hobbie and began to buy motorcycles and cars to resell as well as serving. Within time things began to get better and had to quit serving to fully dedicate my self to the buy and resell. Sports was also something that really interested me. I loved playing and watching just about any sport (except golf and tennis). Being in the US opened a lot of door for me. It changed me as a person. It changed my perspective on life and how it should be looked at. One of the things that made the most impact is that sky is the limit. After being deported and got to Mexico things got a little rough. I felt lost and everything that I thought I had learned in the states went out the window. Felt like my skills, knowledge and experiences did not matter. As time passed by of feeling lost and not knowing what to do, HolaCode shows up and catches my eyes. Since we all know being in Mexico is not the safest nor can you trust people. With that being said I took it upon me to find out about the school and came to see what it was about. Once learning about the school I saw all the possibilities and opportunities it can give you. Not just job wise but as friendships, family, community and changes. Thanks to HolaCode I have faith again and no longer feel lost or like I dont belong on this beatiful country where I was born and brought up! </p>
